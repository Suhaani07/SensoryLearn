## Introduction

Sensory Learn is an inclusive online educational platform committed to providing education for all, aligning with the United Nations Sustainability Goal No. 4: Quality Education. This platform is specifically designed for underprivileged children who lack access to traditional education. Sensory Learn is available in 30+ languages, ensuring that educational resources are accessible to diverse communities around the world.

## Features

### 1. Customized Curriculum

Sensory Learn offers a tailored curriculum covering essential topics for basic education. Subjects include English, geography, history, computers, and more. The goal is to empower children with the knowledge they need to succeed.

### 2. Text-to-Speech Option

To cater to various learning styles, Sensory Learn incorporates a text-to-speech feature. This functionality ensures that children with different abilities and preferences can engage with the content effectively.

### 3. AI Bot for Doubt Resolution

Sensory Learn provides a unique opportunity for students to ask questions anytime, anywhere. Our AI Bot is capable of understanding queries through typing, speaking, or even sign language. This feature aims to foster a supportive learning environment and address doubts promptly.

### 4. Technology Stack

Sensory Learn utilizes cutting-edge technologies to make its vision a reality. The platform leverages Google's Large Language Model (LLM), Gemini, to deliver personalized and effective educational experiences. In the future, we plan to extend our use of technology by incorporating Mediapipe, TensorFlow, Google Cloud, Google Text-to-Speech APIs, and more.
